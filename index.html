    <p> This is my family. My mother's name is Jacqueline Lopez,
      <br> she is 43 years old. She became the mother and father to us
      <br> since my father had passed away last October 2015.
      <br> I was very lucky and blessed to have a mother like her.
      <br> She never left us and loved us even more even though
      <br> our father was no longer with us. I will do everything
      <br> just to make her proud.
      <br>
      <br> My father's name is Roberto Lopez, he is 51 years old.
      <br> He was a tricycle driver when he was still alive.
      <br> I'm also grateful for having a father like him. Even
      <br> if he leaves early, we will still fulfill our promise
      <br> that we will graduate and we will do everything just
      <br> to make him proud.
      <br>
      <br> My brother's name is Renzo Lopez, he is 17 years old.
      <br> He is now a Grade 11 Stem Student at Rizal High School.

    <h1>Career or Job Position do you see yourself after Graduation</h1>
    <img src="/storage/emulated/0/User Portfolio/images/developer.jpeg">
    <p>
      I see myself as a web developer after our graduation. As an IT student,
      <br>I know this job is difficult but I also thought that I will learn
      <br> more not just in creating websites but many more that are related
      <br> to this course.
      <br>
      <br> I have a small background in html, css and also in c ++. But I
      <br> had a hard time making this webpage because I forgot about the
      <br>others. But with the help of my friend I was able to finish
      <br>this webpage.
      <br>
      <br> I also want to try to be a web designer because I also love
      <br> designing. I like mixing colors and choosing from any designs
      <br>that I want to put on my works.</p>
